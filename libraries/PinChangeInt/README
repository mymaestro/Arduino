	This library was inspired by and derived from "johnboiles" (it seems) 
	PCInt Arduino Playground example here: http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Main/PcInt
	If you are the original author, please let us know at the google code page
	
	It provides an extension to the interrupt support for arduino by
	adding pin change interrupts, giving a way for users to have
	interrupts drive off of any pin.

	Please make any configuration changes in the accompanying PinChangeIntConfig.h file.
	This will help avoid having to reset your config in the event of changes to the 
	library code (just don't replace that file when you update).
