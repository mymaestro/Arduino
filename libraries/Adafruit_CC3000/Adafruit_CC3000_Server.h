  Adafruit CC3000 TCP server implementation based on the same interface as 
  the Arduino Ethernet library server class.

  See http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Ethernet for documentation on the 
  Arduino Ethernet library and its server interface.

  The only difference between this implementation and the Ethernet library
  is that a special client reference facade is returned by the available()
  function, instead of a copy of a client like in the Ethernet library.  This
  is necessary to ensure the buffers that client instances contain aren't
  copied and get out of sync.
